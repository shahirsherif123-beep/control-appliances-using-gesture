# control-appliances-using-gesture
Hello everyone, I’m Shahir Sherif. I am here to introduce a new project designed to assist those who wish to control their fan, light, and other devices while seated. This project is aimed at individuals who would find it beneficial, utilising components such as a gyro sensor, an LED, a buzzer, an Arduino Uno Rev3, a resistor, and connecting wires.
